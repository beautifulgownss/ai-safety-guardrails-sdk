# FAANG-Level Guardrails SDK Roadmap

This roadmap captures the concrete steps required to evolve the SDK from a regex-heavy MVP into a production-grade, FAANG-ready platform. Each phase introduces capabilities that demonstrate ML depth, rigorous evaluation, operational maturity, and real-world impact.

## Phase 1 – ML-Powered Detection (Weeks 1-2)
- **PII Detection:** Fine-tune a transformer (e.g., `bert-base-cased`) on CoNLL-2003, i2b2, and Enron email datasets. Target F1 ≥ 0.94 and ship an `MLPIIDetectorGuard` with model loading + configurable thresholds.
- **Prompt Injection Classifier:** Train a binary classifier on Anthropic, Greshake, and HackAPrompt datasets. Compare precision/recall vs. regex guard.
- **Toxicity Detection:** Integrate a multi-label classifier (Perspective API or fine-tuned DistilBERT) covering toxic, threat, insult, identity hate categories.
- **Hallucination Detection:** Implement retrieval-grounded checks using embeddings + entailment to flag unsupported claims.

## Phase 2 – Rigorous Benchmarking (Week 3)
- **Accuracy Benchmarks:** Publish precision/recall/F1 comparisons vs. Guardrails AI, NeMo Guardrails, AWS Bedrock on public datasets.
- **Latency Benchmarks:** Record P50/P95/P99 latency with and without GPU acceleration. Target P95 < 50 ms.
- **Cost Analysis:** Compute per-request cost and cost-per-million requests under realistic traffic profiles.

## Phase 3 – Adversarial Testing (Week 4)
- **Automated Attacks:** Generate >1000 prompt injection and jailbreak attacks using GPT-4. Categorize by obfuscation level and language.
- **Attack Success Rate:** Track ASR across attack types with targets: basic <2%, obfuscated <10%, multilingual <5%.
- **Jailbreak Library:** Maintain a regression suite for known jailbreaks (DAN, Grand Theft Auto, etc.).

## Phase 4 – Production Observability (Week 5)
- **Tracing:** Add OpenTelemetry spans covering guard evaluation, model inference, and downstream LLM calls.
- **Metrics:** Export Prometheus metrics (`guard_blocks_total`, `guard_latency_seconds`, `guard_errors_total`).
- **Dashboards:** Ship Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and on-call readiness.

## Phase 5 – Framework Integrations (Week 6)
- **LangChain Callback:** Provide a `GuardrailsCallbackHandler` bridging GuardChain events to LangChain.
- **LlamaIndex Integration:** Implement callback manager integration mirroring LangChain parity.
- **Vercel AI SDK (Optional):** Publish a lightweight TypeScript wrapper for Next.js edge deployments.

## Phase 6 – Research Implementation (Week 7)
- Choose one:
  - **Constitutional AI Critique Loop:** Multi-agent critique + revision guard module.
  - **Semantic Attack Detector:** Embedding similarity with anomaly detection for covert injections.
  - **Colang-style DSL:** Guard orchestration DSL for declarative policies.

## Phase 7 – Production Case Study (Week 8)
- **Deployment:** Integrate the SDK into a production workload (side project or partner app).
- **Metrics Collection:** Document before/after incident rates, blocked attacks, false positive rates.
- **Narrative Assets:** Publish a 2000+ word technical deep dive and a 3-minute video walkthrough.

### Success Criteria
- Demonstrate superior accuracy, latency, and cost metrics vs. incumbent guardrail platforms.
- Showcase adversarial robustness and observability instrumentation.
- Provide tangible production impact with measurable security improvements.

This roadmap should accompany weekly status updates and drive PRD-level execution for each milestone.
